Day 60 of 100 days of swift. 

Goal: Fetch data, create structs, show data, navigation links, detail views of each user. Added a little twist changing inactive active property green and red. 
Time taken to code this: 2 Hours. A few hiccups on .onAppear(fetchData) and .resume() also forgot to add the iso8601 decoder. the iso8601 took me ages to figure out, all the views were 
empty because of it.
